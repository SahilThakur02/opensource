## What is Google Summer of Code?
Google Summer of Code is a 10+ year old program that brings students closer to development through open source and support the community as a whole through summer projects. 

Open source organizations and projects can become mentor organizations to provide summer projects that are planned out between the mentors and the contributors before and during the project. Learn more about the program [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).

## Org Description

**Pieces Copilot and Snippet manager** are built to unify your entire toolchain with an on-device copilot that helps you capture, enrich, and reuse useful materials, streamline collaboration, and solve complex problems through a contextual understanding of your workflow. At Pieces.app, we have opened up the core functionality of Pieces OS to give all developers the opportunity to build their own copilots using our toolset.

## Mission Statement

At Open Source by Pieces, we are dedicated to advancing the principles of open source innovation and collaboration. Our mission is to foster a vibrant community of experienced developers, emerging novices, and contributors united in building and shaping our platform through shared knowledge and collective effort. Through the Pieces OS Client SDKs, we strive to empower developers globally to create amazing tools and solutions they would love.

Powered by community-driven development, where diverse perspectives come together to drive meaningful progress through fostering inclusivity, collaboration, and continuous learning, we encourage active participation among our members. Together, we aim to achieve a future where technology serves as a force for positive change and where users and developers alike can build whatever tool fits their needs.

## Our Goals

- Provide powerful workflow tools for developers to assist in maintaining and managing the open-source community as a whole
- Educate developers on using copilots responsibly and to their advantage, while also allowing for learning and growth in their skill set
- Allow developers in locations with limited or poor connections work from home with access to a fast and functional copilot
- Make documentation globally available for all developers regardless of language or race
- Provide the tools needed to switch between different LLMs for any specific tasks
